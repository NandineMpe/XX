    NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

    Note 1: Basis of preparation
    The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union and the Companies Act 2014.

    Note 2: Property, plant and equipment
    Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.

    Note 3: Intangible assets
    Intangible assets are recognised at cost and are amortised over their estimated useful lives. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment annually.

    Note 4: Revenue recognition
    Revenue is recognised when control of goods or services is transferred to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled.
