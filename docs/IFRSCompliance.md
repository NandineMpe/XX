# IFRS Compliance Assessment with LightRAG

## Overview

LightRAG now includes comprehensive IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) compliance assessment capabilities. This feature implements a sophisticated two-step assessment approach that mirrors how human auditors evaluate financial statements for compliance with IFRS requirements.

## Key Features

### Two-Step Assessment Process

1. **Applicability Assessment**: Determines if a given IFRS standard/requirement is relevant to the entity based on its business nature, industry, and activities.

2. **Compliance Assessment**: If and only if the standard/requirement is deemed applicable, then evaluates the Financial Statement Content against that specific requirement.

### Core Capabilities

- **Single Requirement Assessment**: Assess individual IFRS requirements against financial statements
- **Batch Assessment**: Process multiple requirements concurrently for efficiency
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generate detailed compliance reports with executive summaries
- **Entity Information Extraction**: Automatically extract entity details from financial statements
- **IFRS Requirements Parsing**: Parse IFRS requirements from text documents
- **Risk Assessment**: Identify and categorize compliance risks
- **Recommendations Engine**: Provide actionable recommendations for compliance improvement

## Architecture

### Components

1. **IFRSComplianceAssessor**: Main class for performing compliance assessments
2. **Data Models**: Structured data classes for requirements, assessments, and results
3. **API Routes**: RESTful endpoints for compliance operations
4. **Prompt Templates**: Specialized prompts for IFRS assessment tasks

### Data Flow

```
IFRS Requirements → Applicability Assessment → Compliance Assessment → Summary Report
     ↓                      ↓                        ↓                    ↓
Text/PDF Input → Business Context Analysis → Evidence Evaluation → Executive Summary
```

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- LightRAG installed and configured
- OpenAI API key (or other supported LLM provider)
- Python 3.8+

### Configuration

1. Set up your environment variables:
```bash

}
```

## Assessment Process

### Step 1: Applicability Assessment

The system first determines if an IFRS standard is applicable to the entity by considering:

- **Business Nature**: What type of business the entity operates
- **Industry Context**: The specific industry and sector
- **Operational Activities**: Core business activities and transactions
- **Regulatory Environment**: Applicable regulations and standards

**Possible Outcomes:**
- `APPLICABLE`: The standard is relevant to the entity
- `NOT_APPLICABLE`: The standard is not relevant (e.g., IFRS 17 for a manufacturing company)

### Step 2: Compliance Assessment

Only if the standard is applicable, the system evaluates compliance by:

- **Evidence Analysis**: Examining financial statement content for compliance evidence
- **Requirement Mapping**: Matching IFRS requirements to financial statement disclosures
- **Gap Identification**: Identifying missing or insufficient information
- **Compliance Scoring**: Determining compliance status

**Possible Outcomes:**
- `COMPLIANT`: Financial statements meet the requirement
- `NON_COMPLIANT`: Financial statements do not meet the requirement
- `INSUFFICIENT_INFO`: Not enough information to determine compliance
- `N/A_NOT_APPLICABLE`: Standard was not applicable (from Step 1)

## Output Formats

### Assessment Results

Each assessment produces structured results including:

```json
{
  "applicability_assessment": {
    "status": "APPLICABLE|NOT_APPLICABLE",
    "reasoning": "Detailed explanation of applicability decision"
  },
  "compliance_assessment": {
    "status": "COMPLIANT|NON_COMPLIANT|INSUFFICIENT_INFO|N/A_NOT_APPLICABLE",
    "reasoning": "Detailed explanation of compliance decision",
    "evidence_citations": [
      "Direct quotes from financial statements"
    ],
    "suggested_follow_up": "Recommendations for improvement"
  }
}
```

### Comprehensive Reports

Detailed reports include:

- **Executive Summary**: High-level compliance overview
- **Risk Assessment**: Categorized compliance risks
- **Recommendations**: Actionable improvement suggestions
- **Detailed Assessments**: Individual requirement assessments
- **Statistics**: Compliance metrics and scores

## Best Practices

### Preparing IFRS Requirements

1. **Structured Format**: Use consistent formatting for requirement text
2. **Clear Identification**: Include standard names and requirement IDs
3. **Categorization**: Group requirements by category and priority
4. **Context**: Provide additional IFRS context when needed

### Financial Statement Preparation

1. **Complete Content**: Include all relevant financial statement sections
2. **Clear Formatting**: Ensure text is properly formatted and readable
3. **Entity Information**: Include business description and industry context
4. **Comparative Data**: Include comparative information when available

### Assessment Configuration

1. **Concurrency**: Adjust `max_concurrent` based on system capabilities
2. **Context**: Provide additional IFRS context for complex requirements
3. **Validation**: Review assessment results for accuracy
4. **Documentation**: Maintain audit trails of assessments

## Examples

### Running the Demo

```bash
# Set up environment
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"

# Run the demo
python examples/ifrs_compliance_demo.py
```

### Custom Implementation

```python
# Load IFRS requirements from file
with open("ifrs_requirements.txt", "r") as f:
    ifrs_text = f.read()

requirements = await compliance_assessor.load_ifrs_requirements_from_text(ifrs_text)

# Extract entity information
entity_name, business_description = await compliance_assessor.extract_entity_info_from_afs(afs_content)

# Perform comprehensive assessment
results = await compliance_assessor.assess_multiple_requirements(
    entity_name=entity_name,
    entity_business_description=business_description,
    ifrs_requirements=requirements,
    afs_content=afs_content
)

# Generate report
summary = compliance_assessor.calculate_compliance_summary(results)
report = await compliance_assessor.generate_compliance_report(
    entity_name=entity_name,
    entity_business_description=business_description,
    assessment_results=results,
    summary=summary
)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Key Issues**: Ensure your LLM API key is properly configured
2. **Memory Limitations**: Reduce `max_concurrent` for large assessments
3. **Timeout Errors**: Increase timeout settings for complex requirements
4. **Parsing Errors**: Check IFRS requirement format and delimiters

### Performance Optimization

1. **Batch Processing**: Use batch assessment for multiple requirements
2. **Caching**: Leverage LightRAG's built-in caching mechanisms
3. **Concurrency**: Adjust concurrent processing based on system resources
4. **Chunking**: Break large financial statements into manageable chunks
